# Circuit Scramble: General report

This week's work introduced:

* boolean logic as digital logic
* digital circuits and new corresponding elements of our ISA
* tools and vocabulary to describe digital circuits (e.g. truth tables)
* (optional) the concept of the stack

Respond to the following prompts about the programs illustrating these concepts.

## In your own words, describe `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` "gates".

### `AND`

`TODO`

### `OR`

`TODO`

### `NOT`

`TODO`

## The `equality` circuit "flips" some of the signals using `NOT` gates. Why is that useful?

`TODO`

## Provide the truth table for the majority function below.

>Note, you will need to add more columns to this Markdown table. For a refresher, see [GitHub's documentation on the subject](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/organizing-information-with-tables).

|A |B |C |Output|
|:-|:-|:-|:-----|
|`TODO`  |`TODO`  |`TODO`  |`TODO`      |

## Provide the final boolean logic expression for the `majority` circuit.

`TODO`

### How did you arrive at that expression? Describe your process.

`TODO`

## This exercise effectively turned our Pico into an integrated circuit (IC; think "dedicated chip"). Recall early notions of a fixed-program computer -- can you see a use case for this kind of programming? If so, what is it?

> Hint: Why does the question refer to a "fixed-program computer," and what _is_ that? You might look up some examples from our early discussions.
